Welcome to FEMfuns (Finite Element Method for useful neuroscience simulations).

FEMfuns allows neuroscientists to solve the forward problem in a variety of different geometrical domains, including various types of source models and electrode properties, such as resistive and capacitive materials.
The original paper can be found 

The results of using FEMfuns demonstrate that the pipeline presented in this paper is an accurate and fexible tool to simulate signals generated on electrode grids by the spatiotemporal electrical activity patterns produced by cortical neurons and thereby allows the user to optimize grids for brain computer interfaces including exploration of alternative electrode materials/properties.
